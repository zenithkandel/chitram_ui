<!-- Placeholder for artwork images -->
<!-- This file can be used as a reference for image organization -->

Placeholder images needed:
- sample-artwork-1.jpg
- sample-artwork-2.jpg  
- sample-artwork-3.jpg
- sample-artwork-4.jpg
- sample-artwork-5.jpg
- sample-artist.jpg
- placeholder-artwork.jpg

You can add actual images to the /public/images directory.
For now, the server will handle missing images gracefully.
